A tiny routing solution for modern React apps that relies on Hooks. A router you wanted so bad in your project!

- Zero dependency, only **1.16KB** gzipped vs 17KB [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router).
- Supports both **React** and **[Preact](https://preactjs.com/)**! Read _["Preact support" section](#preact-support)_ for more details.
- No top-level `<Router />` component, it is **fully optional**.
- Mimics [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)'s best practices, however the library isn't a drop-in replacement.
- Out of the box only supports History API, customization is possible via a `<Router />` component.

## How to get started?

Check out this demo app below in order to get started:

```js
import { Link, Route } from "wouter";

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <Link href="/users/1">
      <a className="link">Profile</a>
    </Link>

    <Route path="/about">About Us</Route>
    <Route path="/users/:name">
      {params => <div>Hello, {params.name}!</div>}
    </Route>
    <Route path="/inbox" component={InboxPage} />
  </div>
);
```

### ⚠️ This library comes untranspiled, please read this!

**TL;DR** Want to support IE11 → make sure you transpile `node_modules`.

The library is written in pure ES6 and it doesn't come with transpiled sources, while only stable features like arrow functions and destructuring assignment are used. There is a [huge debate going on](https://gist.github.com/Rich-Harris/51e1bf24e7c093469ef7a0983bad94cb) it the community on whether or not library authors should ship untranspiled code.

Wouter was designed to be as small as possible and the decision to ship untranspiled code was made intentionally. We don't use unstable things like generators or async functions, that said it should work fine on the [majority of the browser](https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6). If you'd like to aim platforms like IE11, please make sure you run Babel over your `node_modules`.

## Wouter API

### The power of HOOKS!

**wouter** relies heavily on [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). Thus it makes creating custom interactions such as route transitions or accessing router directly easier. You can check if a particular route matches the current location by using a `useRoute` hook:

```js
import { useRoute } from "wouter";
import { Transition } from "react-transition-group";

const AnimatedRoute = () => {
  // `match` is boolean
  const [match, params] = useRoute("/users/:id");

  return <Transition in={match}>This is user ID: {params.id}</Transition>;
};
```

### Matching Dynamic Segments

Just like in React Router you can make dynamic matches either with `Route` component or `useRoute` hook.
`useRoute` returns a second parameter which is a hash of all dynamic segments matched. Similarily, the
`Route` component passes these parameters down to its children via a function prop.

```js
import { useRoute } from "wouter";

// /users/alex => [true, { name: "alex "}]
// /anything   => [false, null]
const [match, params] = useRoute("/users/:name");

// or with Route component
<Route path="/users/:name">
  {params => {
    /* { name: "alex" } */
  }}
</Route>;
```

**wouter** implements a limited subset of [`path-to-regexp` package](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp)
used by React Router or Express, and it supports the following patterns:

- Named dynamic segments: `/users/:foo`.
- Dynamic segments with modifiers: `/foo/:bar*`, `/foo/baz?` or `/foo/bar+`.

The library was designed to be as small as possible, so most of the additional matching feature were left out
(see [this issue](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter/issues/1) for more info).
If you do need to have `path-to-regexp`-like functionality you can customize a matcher function:

```js
import { Router } from "wouter";
import createMatcher from "wouter/matcher";

import pathToRegexp from "path-to-regexp";

const App = () => (
  <Router matcher={createMatcher(pathToRegexp)}>
    {/* segment constraints aren't supported by wouter */}
    <Route path="/users/:id(\d+)" />}
  </Router>
);
```

### Working with History

By default `wouter` creates an internal History object that observes the changes of the current location. If you need a custom history observer, for example for hash-based routing you can implement your [own history](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter/blob/master/history.js).

```js
import { Router, Route, useRouter } from "wouter"

const App => (
  <Router history={myHashHistory}>
    <Route path="/about" component={About} />
    ...
  </Router>
)

// you can later access the history object through the router object
const Foo = () => {
  const router = useRouter()

  // manually changes the location
  return <div onClick={() => router.history.push("/orders")}>My Orders</div>
}
```

## FAQ and Code Recipes

### How do I make a default/fallback route?

One of the common patterns in application routing is having a default route that will be shown as a fallback, in case no other route matches (for example, if you need to render 404 message). In **wouter** this can easily be done as a combination of `<Switch />` component and catch-all route:

```js
import { Switch, Route } from "wouter";

<Switch>
  <Route path="/about">...</Route>
  <Route path="/:rest*">404, not found!</Route>
</Switch>;
```

### Can I use _wouter_ in my TypeScript project?

Yes! Although the project isn't written in TypeScript there is a [type definition package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/wouter) available through [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped). Simply add `npm install --save-dev @types/wouter` to your project and develop safely with types.

### Preact support?

The Preact exports are available within the `wouter/preact` namespace:

```diff
- import { useRoute, Route, Switch } from "wouter";
+ import { useRoute, Route, Switch } from "wouter/preact";
```

You might need to ensure you have the latest version of [Preact X](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/releases/tag/10.0.0-alpha.0) with support for hooks.

### Is there a support for server-side rendering (SSR)?

Yes! In order to render your app on a server you'll need to tell the router that the current location comes from the request rather than the browser history. In **wouter** you can achieve that by passing the static history to the top-level `<Router />` component:

```js
import staticHistory from "wouter/extra/static-history";
import { renderToString } from "react-dom/server";

import App from "./app";

const handleRequest = (req, res) => {
  const prerendered = renderToString(
    <Router history={staticHistory(req.path)}>
      <App />
    </Router>
  );

  // respond with prerendered html
};
```

Make sure you replace the static history with the real one when you hydrate your app on a client.
